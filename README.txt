 TEAM FLYING MONKEYS
======================


Entire Site:

 - Since Gowan Automotive Service is a small business, we decided that we needed a simple and not very flashy website, but we still wanted it to look very nice and professional. 

 - To design our logo, we used a website called Free Logo Design. There, we found a wide variety of logos to choose from, and we chose the one that worked the best with the design of our website.

 - We went more simple and catchy with the tagline, "Friendly Mechanic for Your Automotive Needs." We wanted to keep a simple and intimate tone so that it follows the simple flow of the rest of the website, and we also needed it to be something you can remember.

 - We used a soft, and professional looking font to keep our website looking sleek, and to keep it from being intimidating.

 - All of our CSS is very tidy and organized. We separated each page and some different elements into their own sections. We also had a separate section for media queries. That way it is easy to maneuver for someone that is just interested in the code, or if we ever need to fix anything.

 - We created a favicon that is similar to the logo, just to create extra branding on the website and to improve the user experience.

 - We added a sticky navigation bar to assist in the user's navigation of the website by keeping the links on the screen at all times without taking up too much space.


Home Page:

 - We started off by giving you a basic idea of the environment and what the company is about in the welcome section. 

 - We used a slideshow of cars being worked on so that there is no way that you are left guessing what Gowan Automotive Services does.

 - We used an invisible table to give you the business hours, so that you know when you may stop by and ask for help with your vehicle.


About Page:

 - Our goal with the About page was helping you get to know Ricky Gowan, and giving you his qualifications.

 - We gave you a picture of Mr. Gowan to keep a sense of familiarity, and so you know who to look for if you visit.


Services Page:

 - To keep you aware of your most probable options, we added a very nice and organized gallery with a list of services, and pictures of the services.

 - We wanted to do a slide-show at first, but we decided that a gallery would be more efficient because you don't have to go through the whole thing to find what you're looking for.


Pricing Page:

 - On the far left, we gave you the general pricing details which explain how the price of your repair is calculated.

 - In the middle we added a table with the most common prices for the most common jobs, so you have easy access to information that you would otherwise have to contact us about.

 - On the far right, we just wanted to make you aware that you are able to contact us if need be.


Contact Page:

 - Our contact page contains a form to make asking us a question or contacting us much simpler and easier to you.

 - We also put in a list of ways to contact us, and hyperlinked them to save you a little bit of struggle.

 - Underneath our little list, we added a user interactive map so that you can easily find where you need to be to get your car fixed. 

  Contact Form - We created two separate pages to determine whether all of the information was put in correctly which prompts a page with a response, or incorrectly, which prompts a page telling you that something went wrong.


Testimonials:

 - On the testimonials page, we just put in a slideshow with outside opinions so that you feel more trusting and perhaps had some of your questions answered.
